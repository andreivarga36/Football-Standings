# Football Standings
In this project I've implemented an solution for tracking football team standings. Code follows object-oriented principles, with classes such as "Standings" and "Team" representing objects with properties and methods.

Also, this implementation includes a sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort) in order to arrange football teams based on their points
